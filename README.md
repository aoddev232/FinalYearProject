# FinalYearProject
## Can artificial intelligence reduce traffic congestion in cities?
Conventional traffic light systems that are currently in place are inefficient and, in many cases, generate more traffic congestion than they resolve. In this final year project, I address these challenges by developing a traffic flow and congestion prediction model by implementing a Long-Short-Term Memory Neural Network (LSTM), focusing on increasing throughput, safety, and efficiency. This research is particularly significant given the rapidly increasing presence of autonomous vehicles on our roads each year.

This repository contains comprehensive documentation and source code for the project, including, but not limited to:
- The datasets used to train the prediction model, supplied by South Dublin City Council (SDCC)
- Data Analysis Phase
- Data Preprocessing Procedure
- Building, training, and comparing 81 LSTM neural network traffic flow prediction models
- Collection and presentation of results
- The final report paper in PDF format
