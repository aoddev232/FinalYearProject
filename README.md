# FinalYearProject
FYP - Using Artificial Intelligence to prevent traffic congestion in Dublin
The capabilities of humans executing complex tasks is rapidly being overtaken by artificial intelligence and machine learning.
Conventional traffic light systems that are currently in place are inefficient and in many cases, generate more traffic congestion and they resolve. In my final year project, I will aim to address these challenges by comparing and contrasting various traffic congestion
control systems that can be implemented using artificial intelligence and machine learning by focusing on increasing throughput, safety and efficiency. This is especially important because the number of autonomous vehicles is increasing faster year after year. By
researching and constructing different AI approaches to this issue, I can answer the question of “Can Artificial Intelligence Reduce Traffic Congestion in Cities” myself, reinforced by my own research, statistics, implementations, simulations and conclusions.
